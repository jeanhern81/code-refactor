A README for the Heriseon website.

The Heriseon website needed a few adjustments before its launch. I added/modified:

- semantic html elements,
- alt attributes to the images to make the website accessible to the visual impared,
- made sure headings were in sequestinal order.
- consolidated css selectors.

There are no copyright or license information at the present time.
